# GSM_Linux_Kernel_LPE_Nday_Exploit
LPE exploit in the linux module n_gsm.c. This module is used to implement the GSM 07.10 multiplexing protocol. This type of error was “Race Condtiton” which results in “User - After - Free”. Looking at the code, I realized that this could be used to execute my code in the Linux kernel and get LPE on a potential victim.
