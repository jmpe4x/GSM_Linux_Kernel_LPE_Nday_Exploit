# GSM_Linux_Kernel_LPE_Nday_Exploit
LPE exploit in the linux module n_gsm.c. This module is used to implement the GSM 07.10 multiplexing protocol. This type of vulnerability is a Race Condtiton which results in UAF. Looking at the code, I realized that this could be used to execute my code in the Linux kernel and get LPE on a potential victim.
